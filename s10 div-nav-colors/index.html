            Now
            that Wayne Manor

            Nolan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2019, and received a knighthood in
            2024 for his contributions to film.

            Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University
            College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with Following (1998). Nolan
            gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), and transitioned into studio
            filmmaking with Insomnia (2002). He became a high-profile director with The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012),
            and found further success with The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk
            (2017). After the release of Tenet (2020), Nolan parted ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros.
            Pictures, and signed with Universal Pictures for the biographical thriller Oppenheimer (2023), which won him
            Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.

            Nolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a
            metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time,
            and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically inspired images and
            concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes,
            large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with
            his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.</p>
